# Inhabitent

- Implementation of a theme for wordpress using php, html, css and javascript.

# Development approach

- First it was to make all the content of the site available in the wordpress templates in its correct location. The entire registration was done using the wordpress management interface.
- Specific templates were created to place the contents in the correct places, such as: single-product\_type.php, taxonomy-product\_taxonomy.php, content-page-about.php, content-product.php, content-product-single.php and etc.
- To customize the pages, I followed the style sheet on the website https://tent.academy.red/. Much of the classes and styles were copied and pasted exactly like this site. However, I had to make some changes to adapt to the way I was implementing it.
- I versioned all the plugins that were used in the development of this theme.

# Main implementation challenges

- Learn the syntax of php.
- Understand how the wordpress hierarchy works.
- Understand which exact wordpress function should be used for each type of information required.
- Configure font-awesome to be used with sass.
- Implement a javascript that works within wordpress management.
- Understand how to style the style sheet together with wordpress.

# What is missing

- No Stretch Goals have been implemented.
- Some pages were not fully stylized as they should be in the mock.
- Create an implementation to decrease repetition of css.
